## Sprint 2

### Target Platform

This game is developed for use over browsers, specifically on desktop or laptop dimensions (~ 16:9, 12" and greater displays). The layout of the webpage is designed so that it can take advantage of the space across the screen. This allows the presentation of both boards simultaneously, as well as a history of recent actions.

### Intended Users

This is built for users who played the original Battleship board game. The idea is to bring the feel of that game to the browser while retaining the same aspects of the board game. Users who fall into this category should experience a certain familiarity with playing this version of the game, even if it's their first time.
